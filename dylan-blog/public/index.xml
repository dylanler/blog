      <description>Thoughts about self-help books ðŸ“š People often ask me to recommend a self-help book that might help them achieve something be it losing weight, investing, building careers and etc.

I mean I&amp;rsquo;m sure self-help books can be useful if you can apply what the author is asking you to do seamlessly into your life. However I find that to be easier said than done.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;CEO/founders should interview every candidate until the company is at least 500 employees.&amp;rdquo; â€” Keith Rabois
Good news. Your startup has gained some kind of traction and has finally achieved some sort of product-market-fit. You, the founder, are assuming the roles of all the C-suite executives.

      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you think of all the things that make for good TV, do none of them. Focus on the things that make for boring TV â€” sitting and coding, talking with customers, making sales calls.&amp;rdquo; â€” Sam Altman
