[{"content":"Thoughts about self-help books ðŸ“š People often ask me to recommend a self-help book that might help them achieve something be it losing weight, investing, building careers and etc.\nTill date I always have the same reply, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t read self-help books\u0026rdquo;.\nI mean I\u0026rsquo;m sure self-help books can be useful if you can apply what the author is asking you to do seamlessly into your life. However I find that to be easier said than done.\nAn author can ask you to follow a certain diet, focus on a certain task, invest in certain stocks, save a certain amount of money, set reminders and goals and anything else. But often times an individual\u0026rsquo;s circumstances in life is not as straightforward as just applying what one person in a book is saying.\nFor example, a person might not be financially literate enough to even know how to buy a stock due to lack of education. Or a person\u0026rsquo;s abusive environment might not let him or her just set goals and follow them easily.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that self-help books treat everything as black and white and assume there\u0026rsquo;s a cookie-cutter solution that applies to every reader. I think most people understand themselves better than an author that never met you in your life before.\nHence I would like to give an alternative to self-help books: read a diverse range of topics in general. I also recommend reading science from its basic sources such as physics, biology, psychology and neuroscience to help you understand what is within the realms of possibility and to also understand how your mind and body function.\nIf science just bores you that\u0026rsquo;s okay too. Read books about case studies and biographies\u0026ndash;draw on people\u0026rsquo;s past experience and formulate what works for you. Rather than reading an advice that is telling you what to do, try to diversify your reading and pick and choose what can apply in your life in that specific moment.\nIn time I think you will find solutions to your problems that are tailored made for you and by you.\nAnd with that, you gain the most powerful self-help ability: the actual ability to help yourself with a solution crafted by you.\nOf course if a self-help book works for you then all the power to you too. They won\u0026rsquo;t be bestsellers if they aren\u0026rsquo;t at least working for some people.\nBut I implore you to try other books for a change, you might gain more insights than you think :)\nCheers.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/self-help-books/","summary":"Thoughts about self-help books ðŸ“š People often ask me to recommend a self-help book that might help them achieve something be it losing weight, investing, building careers and etc.\nTill date I always have the same reply, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t read self-help books\u0026rdquo;.\nI mean I\u0026rsquo;m sure self-help books can be useful if you can apply what the author is asking you to do seamlessly into your life.

As such, I will be summarizing some of the recurring elements that stood out to me.\nOne thing that really surprised me is that really large companies are not run as efficiently as you think. A lot of times, bureaucracy gets piled up that causes employees to lose the initial spark they had when they joined the company. Hence, this results in big companies having \u0026ldquo;payroll employees\u0026rdquo; where their only reason of remaining in the company is to receive their next paycheck. These employees lose their motivation to bring in their A game while working and will only stifle further growth for the company. If something is not done to reverse the effects, soon the enthusiastic employees will too lose all hope and in turn leave or transform into one of the \u0026ldquo;payroll employees\u0026rdquo;.\nOne of the best way a company could prevent this is to establish an official channel where employees are able to contribute to the company\u0026rsquo;s growth directly. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, the really successful companies such as Google, Facebook, Airbnb and etc really encourage and welcome their employees to contribute whatever they can to the company\u0026rsquo;s improvement. These companies took the effort to deliberately set up channels and environments where their employees feel safe to express their opinions on how the company should move forward.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve passed product market fit, you\u0026rsquo;re no longer building a product, you\u0026rsquo;re building a company. Essentially, you\u0026rsquo;re building your hive, your people and your culture. The highly successful companies understand that their biggest asset right now is their people and they do everything that they can to leverage on their ambitions and eagerness to help shape the company. For example, Google has long been known for implementing the 20% time project where employees can dedicate a portion of their work time in doing anything they like. At that time, this kind of corporate culture is unheard of and was viewed negatively by other companies. As it turns out, the 20% project actually contributed a lot to Google\u0026rsquo;s growth which ultimately shaped them to be the company they are known today. Often times, these 20% projects are simple projects that help improve the way things are run around Google. A lot of these 20% project actually went on to become official Google products that brought it different forms of revenue to Google.\nRecently, I had the privilege to listen to Marissa Myer, the CEO of Yahoo speak. She mentioned that when she took over as Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s CEO, a lot of the Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s employees were very disconnected with the higher level executives. The only time employees had an opportunity to speak their mind was during the quarterly all company meetings that happens 4 times a year. As such, Marissa actually spent a lot of time in Yahoo\u0026rsquo;s cafeteria to talk to employees to understand their concerns at the lower level. In addition to that, she also launched the \u0026ldquo;CEO challenge\u0026rdquo; at Yahoo where she challenged every employee in Yahoo to come up with anything that can bring in revenue for Yahoo through channels that have never been thought of. From the challenge, she received hundreds of application where employees would work extra hours just to get their opinions and ideas across to the CEO. At the end of the program, Marissa realized that a lot of employees actually want to contribute beyond their work to make the company better but all they are lacking is the proper channel. As Marissa simply puts it: \u0026ldquo;If your employees want to go above and beyond to improve the company, why not let them?\u0026rdquo;. Even better yet, why not help them?\nCEOs are like football players The second thing I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up from Marissa is that CEOs in large scale companies should act as the bulldozer during a roadblock. No longer are you the person building the product, making changes to your website or directly going out to find customers. You now lead a team of hundreds or thousands of people and your job as a CEO is basically to point the company towards a direction and do your best to get rid of all the obstacles that may hinder your employees from executing it. You can say that the CEO is somehow like a football player that tackles anyone that gets in the way so that your employees can reach the touch down line.\nAnother recurring theme for really successful companies is the preservation of company culture while scaling the workforce. Brian Chesky, the founder and CEO of Airbnb mentioned that he personally interviewed the first few hundred employees himself to preserve the culture he wanted at Airbnb. Today, anyone that interviewed for Airbnb is required to go through two culture interviews to determine if they fit the culture of Airbnb. Brian also dispute the notion that a company\u0026rsquo;s culture should be developed organic. He mentions that culture is separated into two â€” strong culture and weak culture and if you do not intervene to shape your company\u0026rsquo;s culture from the source, your company will eventually develop a weak culture that you might not like. Liking the work culture goes a long way as it helps everyone in the company communicate better and not hate each other (which is actually pretty important while growing a company).\nGrow your company\u0026rsquo;s culture by setting the core values during hiring As a summary, the lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered from large scale companies are as follow:\nProvide a channel for your super loyal and enthusiastic employees to go above and beyond. It means a lot to them.\nThe purpose of the CEO at this stage is to clear all roadblocks so that the company can sprint forward with its full potential.\nCompany culture is not developed organically. Set a few boundaries and core values and ingrain them right from the hiring process.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-little-things/","summary":"For the past few weeks, I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to startup founders about how they scaled their companies while preserving their core values at the same time.

Your startup has gained some kind of traction and has finally achieved some sort of product-market-fit. You, the founder, are assuming the roles of all the C-suite executives. You are making sales calls, you are having meetings every other day, you are managing the back-end server of your startup and you have no sleep. Don\u0026rsquo;t fret! Just breathe. These problems are all good problems to have. When you have reached this stage of the startup journey, you are now set to face your next great challenge â€” scaling your team. It is time to evolve your team from a family to a tribe.\nFor simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake, let us define what a tribe means in startup scaling. For the purpose of this article, we shall define the tribe as your first 100 employees. In this article, I will try to break down the common mistakes of founders and offer some solutions based on the findings I obtained.\nHiring is Key Let us start with the topic of hiring. Believe it or not, hiring is actually one of the most important tasks for a founder at the tribal stage. According to Sam (YC President), founders should look to spend about a third of their time hiring people. Many founders often overlook this aspect and treat hiring as just a side task for them. Even worse, some founders even justify that outsourcing the hiring process will be just as good as doing it themselves.\nJust the same as doing customer discovery during the family stage (1â€“10 employees), founders should also get down and dirty to conduct the hiring process at the tribal stage (10â€“100 employees). Since Sam Altman wrote a really good article about hiring, I would not dwell much into the subject but instead recommend everyone to head on to the article to get a good feel on how to hire.\nDefining Company Culture The second thing that a founder should keep track of is defining company culture. Since the startup is the brainchild of the founder, its culture should be defined by the founder too. When hiring, founders should never compromise and only hire people that could potentially fit the company culture.\nAfter hiring, founders should have a set framework on how the company should behave. Personally, I found the framework from Tribal Leadership, written by Dave Logan to explain company culture really well. For a summary, Tribal Leadership defines the 5 stages of company culture that is categorized into:\nStage 1: Survival mode â€” employees are there just there to make ends meet. Stage 2: Life sucks â€” employees do not enjoy their work whatsoever and zero innovation takes place. Stage 3: I\u0026rsquo;m great, you suck â€” employees resent each other and are continuously competing with each other to get promoted. Stage 4: We\u0026rsquo;re all great â€” employees enjoy their work and have a common enemy like an external competitor. Stage 5: Life is great, nothing is impossible â€” employees are excited about their work and want to create new innovations together. In short, founders should try to shape their startups to achieve at least a stage 4 or 5 culture. A successful startup at the tribal stage should consist of employees that are excited about their work.\nKeeping Focus with Small Teams When scaling your team, it is important to keep your employees focused on the startup\u0026rsquo;s mission. The worst thing that could happen is having a large amount of employees but no one is actually doing any substantial work. One solution to this problem is distributing your tribe into smaller work-groups.\nIt is widely known that startups excel because the team is smaller where bureaucracy is at its minimum. As you scale larger, you want to expand the workforce without sacrificing the quality of work. By separating your team into smaller work-groups and assigning a leader in each group, employees can take more ownership in their work. Allow the smaller work-groups to make decisions on their own, take up projects on their own and only report to the work-group leader. That way, employees have a sense of ownership and responsibility as they are given the authority to make decisions that shapes the company\u0026rsquo;s growth.\nRecap As a recap, here are some of the things that I think startup founders should focus on when scaling their team into the tribal stage:\nDo not neglect hiring. Founders get down to the ground and be involved in the process. Define your company culture from the get go. Separate your tribe (100 people) to smaller work-groups (20 people) to provide a sense of ownership.

Focus on the things that make for boring TV â€” sitting and coding, talking with customers, making sales calls.\u0026rdquo; â€” Sam Altman\nThe family stage of startups as defined by Reid Hoffman is the stage where a startup has assembled its founding team and is ready to take on the world with their minimum viable product.\nWhile I have not personally started any company of my own, I have spent a fair amount of time in the startup ecosystem to observe what sort of mistakes and pitfalls founders usually fall into. These mistakes might seem obvious to an observer but it can often times clog the founder\u0026rsquo;s intuition until it is pointed out to them. A lot of these mistakes happen when founders get distracted by work that seems important but provides no value for their startup in the family stage. For this article, I will provide three of the most common mistakes I observed in early stage startups and why it occurs time and time again.\n1. Adding features excessively The first mistake that founders often make is being overly obsessive on adding new features for their product. In the startup world, doing one thing and doing it really well pays off. This delusion, through my observations, originates more from founders who do not necessarily have a technical background. This might be due to the fact that these founders lack the understanding of painstakingly difficult it is to actually create a feature of a website or mobile application and iterate it into perfection. They often have the illusion of \u0026ldquo;if only\u0026rdquo; and will delay their product launch just because they wanted to add a feature to their product because \u0026ldquo;if only\u0026rdquo; the product had this feature, it will certainly beat out competitors. These founders are so paranoid about launching the perfect and feature loaded product that they will delay the launch of their product and eventually die out. I think one of the most crucial steps for founders during the product development stage is to learn how to say no and to not let excess features creep in.\n2. Indulge in vanity metrics and press coverage The second mistake that I think most family stage startups fall victim to is making the mistake of cheating themselves with vanity metrics and excessive press coverage. A lot of startup founders have this fantasy in their head that if only they had a super-mega-ultra launch party with all the press coverage, their startup can certainly be an overnight success. They tend to forget the one core thing family stage startups are supposed to do â€” building \u0026amp; improving the product to acquire loyal customers. When you see a founder spending more time at networking events and conferences than actually working on product development then you know that the startup is not heading in the right direction. Sure the idea might be great, but is it so great that with a grand launch, everyone will automatically whip out their phones and rush to the app store to download it? Even the largest companies today could not pull that of a feat. Unless your idea is giving out free gold bars on a mobile app, it is far more productive to actually focus on product development and sales than to partake in any kind of PR events.\n3. Outsourcing everything without understanding your product The third mistake that founders often make is having the belief that everything can be solved by outsource work. Without the emergence of more and more developers and tools, there is a notion that founders with zero technical knowledge can successfully build billion dollar tech startups. While it is entirely possible, it is often rare that a startup without any technical co-founder can iterate their product into something that the original founders envisioned. While you do not need advance technical knowledge to start a tech startup, founders should take the initiative to learn the basics about the technology powering their product. The startups that tend to fail usually consist of founders who refuse to learn anything about their own product and believe that through outsourcing, they can build a product that is just as good as their competitors\u0026rsquo;. I guess the fault lies in the founders not entirely understanding their product. Without even understanding your own product, there is no way you can connect with customers to grasp their perspective on your product.\nConclusion Here\u0026rsquo;s a recap on the 3 mistakes that I shared today:\nAdding features excessively. Indulge in vanity metrics and press coverage. Outsourcing everything without understanding your product. Of course, there are many other kind of mistakes that family stage startups tend to make without even realizing it. Working in a startup accelerator, you get to see how startups grow or wither. In the end, I think it is important for a startup to understand that often times the boring and unglamorous work that the media rarely portrays is actually of the greatest significance.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/boring-work/","summary":"\u0026ldquo;If you think of all the things that make for good TV, do none of them.
